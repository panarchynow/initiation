# Development Plan Guide

## Plan Structure
A development plan must include:
1. Title with task name
2. Usage instructions
3. Implementation stages
4. Dependencies
5. Notes

## Authoring Rules

### Title
- Format: `# Implementation Plan: <Task Name>`
- Keep it specific and descriptive

### Usage Instructions
- Place directly below the title
- Include step-by-step guide
- List verification commands
- Describe error handling steps

### Implementation Stages
- Number each stage
- Order by dependencies (prerequisites first)
- Each stage includes:
  - Subtitle heading
  - Checklist in `- [ ] Task` format
  - Test creation step
  - Verification step

### Dependencies
- List required libraries and tools
- Only include direct dependencies

### Notes
- Implementation considerations
- Potential improvements
- Limitations and warnings

## Task Principles

### Atomicity
- Each task should be self-contained
- Results must be verifiable
- No undocumented prerequisites

### Sequence
- Tasks follow logical order
- Later tasks can build on earlier ones
- Tests written immediately after implementation

### Verifiability
- Each task has verification steps
- Include all test types
- Include linting

### Clarity
- Use clear, specific language
- Reference exact file/function names
- Specify concrete actions

## Example
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <Task>
