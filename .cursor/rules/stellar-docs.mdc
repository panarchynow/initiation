# Stellar Library Documentation Rule

- **Update README on Edit:** When modifying any file within the `./lib/stellar/` directory, update `./lib/stellar/README.md`.
- **README Content:** The update description in the README must be concise, in English, and focus on technical changes for AI comprehension.
- **Consult README:** Before performing tasks related to the `./lib/stellar/` library, consult `./lib/stellar/README.md` for context and current implementation details.
- **Keep README Current:** If significant new insights, code additions, or updates occur within the `./lib/stellar/` library, update the `./lib/stellar/README.md` accordingly.
