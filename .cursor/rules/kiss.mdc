# KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in design and implementation. Simpler solutions are more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs.

## Guidelines for this project:

### Code Structure
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Avoid premature optimization
- Limit function complexity and length (aim for less than 50 lines per function)

### Components
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Limit props to what is necessary
- Use TypeScript interfaces to document component props
- Break down complex components into smaller, manageable pieces

### State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Only lift state up when necessary
- Avoid deep nesting of contexts
- Use React Query for server state and React state for UI state

### API & Data Fetching
- Create simple, predictable data fetching patterns
- Handle loading and error states consistently
- Use type safety throughout data flow

### Styling
- Favor functional CSS (like Tailwind) for component styling
- Avoid overly complex or deeply nested CSS selectors
- Maintain a consistent design system

### Performance
- Only optimize when there's a measurable performance issue
- Focus on the common path first
- Use React developer tools to identify actual performance bottlenecks
- Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil
