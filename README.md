# Stellar Module Refactoring

## Overview
This project includes a refactored Stellar blockchain integration module that has been reorganized from a monolithic structure into smaller, more maintainable modules following SOLID principles and best practices.

## Module Structure
The Stellar integration functionality has been reorganized into separate modules:

- `lib/stellar/tags.ts` - Tag management for Stellar ManageData operations
- `lib/stellar/mypart.ts` - MyPart key handling utilities
- `lib/stellar/config.ts` - Stellar configuration constants
- `lib/stellar/server.ts` - Stellar server connection
- `lib/stellar/account.ts` - Account data fetching
- `lib/stellar/transactionBuilder.ts` - Transaction building
- `lib/stellar/transactionGenerator.ts` - Transaction generation
- `lib/stellar/transactionVerifier.ts` - Transaction verification
- `lib/stellar/index.ts` - Public API exports

## Design Principles
The refactoring follows these key principles:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Each piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous representation
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Simple solutions are preferred over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Only necessary functionality is implemented
- **Single Responsibility** - Each module has a single, focused responsibility
- **Open/Closed** - Modules are open for extension but closed for modification
- **File size constraints** - No file exceeds 150 lines of code

## Testing
Each module has corresponding unit tests located alongside the implementation files with `.spec.ts` extensions.
