# CorporateForm Component Analysis

This document identifies areas for abstraction and potential duplications in the `CorporateForm` component that can be extracted into a reusable custom hook.

## State Management Patterns

### Form States
- **Form Handling**: Using `useForm` and `useFieldArray` from `react-hook-form` with Zod validation.
- **Loading States**: Multiple loading states (`isSubmitting`, `isFetchingAccountData`).
- **Error States**: Various error states (`fetchError`, `duplicateError`).
- **Data States**: Storing original data (`originalFormData`, `accountDataAttributes`, `lastFetchedAccountId`).
- **UI States**: Visual feedback states (`isCopied`, `transactionXDR`, `uploadTab`, `isFileUploaded`).

### Common Patterns
- **Toggle Patterns**: Setting a state to true, performing an operation, then setting it back to false.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Based on various state combinations.
- **Error Handling**: Setting error states and showing toast notifications.

## Core Logic Blocks

### Stellar Account Data Handling
- **`fetchAccountData`**: Function that fetches data for a given account ID.
  - Validates account ID.
  - Sets loading state.
  - Calls API (`fetchAccountDataAttributes`).
  - Updates state based on result (success or error).
  - This logic is reusable for any Stellar-based form.

### Form Population
- **`populateForm`**: Function that maps blockchain data to form fields.
  - Handles standard fields via a mapping.
  - Special handling for MyParts (array of objects).
  - Special handling for Tags (array of strings).
  - Stores original data for later comparison.
  - This logic is reusable but would need configuration for different schemas.

### Transaction Generation
- **Data Comparison Logic**: Comparing current form data with original data.
  - Field-by-field comparison for standard fields.
  - Special handling for arrays (MyParts, Tags).
  - This pattern would be reusable with configuration.
  
- **Transaction Building**:
  - Two paths: 
    1. For new/updated fields: `generateStellarTransaction` helper.
    2. For deletions (especially MyParts): Direct Stellar SDK usage.
  - This complexity could be extracted and parameterized.

### File Upload Integration
- **Upload Handling**: Logic to upload a file and update the form.
- **Mode Switching**: Tab-based UI to switch between file upload and hash input.
- **State Tracking**: Managing upload status and file information.

### Dynamic Fields Management
- **MyParts Array**: Adding, removing, and validating uniqueness.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Manual validation beyond Zod schema.

## UI Integration Points
The following are key UI integration points where the component uses state values:

- Form submission handling
- Loading indicators rendering
- Error message display
- Field population
- Transaction display and copying
- Auto-scrolling to the transaction display
- MyParts fields rendering and management
- Upload mode switching

## Refactoring Opportunities

### Custom Hook Extraction
A `useStellarForm` hook could encapsulate:
- Form initialization with schema
- State management
- Data fetching and population
- Field array management
- Transaction generation logic
- File upload handling
- Clipboard operations

### Parameterization Needs
The hook would need configuration for:
- Form schema and default values
- Blockchain data mappings (which keys map to which form fields)
- Special field handling (arrays, files, etc.)
- Custom validation logic

### Separation of Concerns
The hook should handle logic while leaving UI rendering to the component:
- Hook: State, data handling, validation, transactions
- Component: UI structure, styling, event binding

## Type Safety Considerations
- Define clear interfaces for hook input props
- Define comprehensive types for hook return values
- Ensure error handling paths maintain type safety
- Document the expected shape of blockchain data

## Conclusion
The `CorporateForm` component contains substantial logic that can be extracted into a reusable hook. The primary challenge will be balancing flexibility (to support different form schemas) with simplicity (avoiding over-parameterization). Following the YAGNI principle, the initial implementation should focus on the current needs while structuring the code to allow for future extensions.
